### **1. Executive Summary**  
This document outlines the strategy for migrating **on-premise servers** from RHEL 6 to RHEL 9. Key considerations include hardware compatibility, physical server downtime management, legacy system integration, and coordination with on-premise infrastructure (e.g., SAN/NAS, local DNS/DHCP). A phased upgrade path (6→7→8→9) is mandatory due to architectural shifts, with emphasis on minimizing downtime and validating physical hardware drivers.  

**Key On-Premise Challenges**:  
- Legacy hardware (e.g., RAID controllers, NICs) compatibility with RHEL 9.  
- Dependency on local infrastructure (e.g., NFS/CIFS mounts, LDAP/AD integration).  
- Physical server reboot scheduling and maintenance windows.  

---

### **2. Migration Scope**  
**In-Scope Systems**:  
- **Physical servers**: Bare-metal systems running RHEL 6.  
- **On-premise virtual machines**: Local hypervisors (VMware vSphere, KVM, etc.).  
- **Critical dependencies**: SAN/NAS storage, local DNS/DHCP, backup appliances.  

**Out-of-Scope**:  
- Cloud or hybrid workloads.  
- Third-party hardware requiring vendor firmware upgrades (e.g., specialized HPC clusters).  

---

### **3. Pre-Migration Planning**  

#### **3.1 Assessment Phase**  
- **Hardware Inventory**:  
  - Document server models, CPUs, NICs, RAID controllers, and firmware versions.  
  - Validate against the [Red Hat Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)](https://hardware.redhat.com/).  
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**:  
  - Map NFS/CIFS mounts, iSCSI targets, and database connections.  
  - Verify compatibility of local authentication systems (e.g., OpenLDAP, Active Directory).  

#### **3.2 Compatibility Checks**  
- **On-Premise Tools**:  
  - Use Red Hat Satellite Server to stage repositories and manage patches.  
  - Run `preupg` on RHEL 6 and `leapp preupgrade` for RHEL 7/8 systems.  
- **Legacy Software**:  
  - Identify applications relying on deprecated kernels or libraries (e.g., Python 2.x, legacy Java).  

#### **3.3 Backup Strategy**  
- **On-Premise Backups**:  
  - Use `dd`, `rsync`, or enterprise tools (e.g., Commvault, Veeam) for full system images.  
  - Test restores to spare hardware to validate recoverability.  
- **Physical Server Snapshots**:  
  - For critical systems, use hardware-based snapshots (e.g., Dell EMC TimeFinder, HPE StoreOnce).  

#### **3.4 Infrastructure Dependencies**  
- **SAN/NAS Storage**:  
  - Confirm multipath I/O configurations and kernel module compatibility (e.g., `dm-multipath`).  
- **Networking**:  
  - Update firewall rules (e.g., `iptables` to `nftables` for RHEL 8+) and VLAN configurations.  

#### **3.5 Project Timeline**  
| **Phase**               | **Duration** | **Responsible Team** |  
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|  
| Hardware/Storage Audit   | 1 Week       | Infrastructure Team   |  
| Pre-Migration Assessment | 2 Weeks      | SysAdmins, Storage Team |  
| RHEL 6→7 Upgrade         | 1 Week       | SysAdmins             |  
| RHEL 7→8 Upgrade         | 1 Week       | SysAdmins             |  
| RHEL 8→9 Upgrade         | 1 Week       | SysAdmins             |  
| Post-Migration Validation | 2 Weeks      | QA, Networking Team  |

### **4. Migration Execution**  

#### **4.1 Step 1: Upgrade RHEL 6 to RHEL 7**  
- **Hardware-Specific Steps**:  
  - Update firmware for RAID controllers and NICs (e.g., Broadcom, Intel).  
  - For legacy hardware without RHEL 7 drivers, plan for replacement.  
- **Process**:  
  - Use `redhat-upgrade-tool` with local repositories hosted on Satellite Server.  

#### **4.2 Step 2: Upgrade RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 Using LEAPP**  
- **On-Premise Adjustments**:  
  - Reconfigure NFS mounts to use `nfsvers=4.2` if required.  
  - Update SELinux policies for local services (e.g., Samba, PostgreSQL).  

#### **4.3 Step 3: Upgrade RHEL 8 to RHEL 9 Using LEAPP**  
- **Critical Actions**:  
  - Validate drivers for GPUs or specialized hardware (e.g., InfiniBand).  
  - Migrate from `yum` to `dnf` and adjust automation scripts.  

---

### **5. Post-Migration Validation**  
- **Hardware Validation**:  
  - Check `dmesg` and `journalctl` for driver errors.  
  - Test RAID array performance with `fio` or `dd`.  
- **Infrastructure Testing**:  
  - Verify SAN/NAS connectivity and multipath failover.  
  - Test local authentication (e.g., `realmd` for AD integration).  

---

### **6. Rollback Plan**  
- **Physical Server Rollback**:  
  1. Restore from full system image backups using PXE boot or bootable media.  
  2. Revert firmware updates if necessary.  
- **Virtual Machine Rollback**:  
  - Revert hypervisor snapshots (e.g., VMware vSphere).  

---

### **7. Documentation and Training**  
- **Updated Documentation**:  
  - Server rack diagrams, IPAM (IP address management) records.  
  - Firmware version logs and hardware warranties.  
- **Training**:  
  - Hands-on sessions for troubleshooting physical hardware post-upgrade.
